Questions for the Interviewer

Remember that the interview is also your opportunity to determine whether the organization has the qualities you are seeking.  Below are a few areas to think of as you form the questions you would like to ask.

    • Environment – Before your interview, you need to determine the type of environment in which you would be most successful.  Do you want to work in a fast paced environment, family friendly environment, or a small laid back environment?  Consider what is important to you, and then be sure to ask about it in the interview.  How would you describe the environment of the department?  
    • Advancement – Asking about advancement is important, but it’s even more important how you ask about advancement.  Everyone wants to get ahead, but you don’t want to give the impression that the job at hand is too junior for you.  Don’t just ask what advancement opportunities are available with out first prefacing your comments.  Explain that you understand that you would expect to be in the current position for 3-5 years but then from that point, where do employees typically move up in the organization?
    • Growth – Another way to ask about advancement is to find out what growth is expected.  As a new employee, if you work hard and the company is growing, the advancement will come naturally.  I read that the organization has grown by 25% in the last 5 years, where do you anticipate future growth to come from?
    • Training – It is always good to ask a question centered on training or development opportunities.  This shows your interest in learning more.  You could ask the interviewer to describe the training opportunities available to new employees.  Or, what can I expect in the way of training as a new employee?
    • Mission – Now here, an employer is going to expect you to have done some research.  However, you can ask a question about the mission as it relates to the information your research.  I understand that customer service is integral to the corporate mission, how do you feel your department supports this mission?  
    • Challenges – What challenges does your department face currently?  What are the challenges I am most likely to face as a new employee in this department?  
    • Anything Else – You should ask any question that will help you in your decision making process for determining if this employer offers the ideal work environment for you.
    • Closing – At the end of the interview, you always want to ask what the next step in the process will be.  Be sure to exchange business cards and thank the interviewer for their time.  Also, at this point, you can show enthusiasm for the opportunity by saying that you are interested in the position and you hope they will consider you strongly. 

Things to Avoid
    • Don’t ask about salary or benefits in the interview unless the interviewer initiates.  These areas are left better to negotiate if you are made an offer.
    • Do not ask questions that are too personal and unrelated to the interview unless the interviewer brings up something while small talking.
