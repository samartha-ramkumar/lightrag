# Custom LIGHTRAG implentation

Add separate storage spaces - PGConversationStorage with efficient handling of jsonb 
LLMServiceFactory with an additional RESTApi Provider
Modification of workspace for faster implementation

NOTE: This repos still might have a few bugs(ex: ollama is not fixed, other minor things) but can be used and served through FastApi(main.py) without problems. Pl modify the .env file as per personal use
